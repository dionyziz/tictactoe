A tic-tac-toe game in Javascript. The computer uses the min-max algorithm and never loses.
This game was inspired by Stanford's http://ai-class.org where I learned the min-max algorithm
by professors Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig.

I hope the code is clear enough for anyone who is taking the class to understand.
